                Tourism is distinguished from exploration in that tourists follow a “beaten path,” 
                benefit from established systems of provision, and, as befits pleasure-seekers, are 
                generally insulated fromdifficulty, danger, and embarrassment. Tourism, however 
                overlaps with other activities, interests, and processes, including, for example,<br><br>
                pilgrimage. This gives rise to shared categories, such as “business tourism,” “sports
                 tourism,” and “medical tourism” (international travel undertaken for the purpose receiving) 
                medical care.The Origins Of TourismBy the early 21st century, international tourism had become<br><br>
                 one of the world’s most important economic activities, and its impact was becoming increasingly 
                apparent from the Arctic to Antarctica. The history of tourism is therefore of great interest and 
                importance. That history begins long before the coinage of the word tourist at the end of the 18th century.<br> <br>
                In the Western tradition, organized travel with supporting infrastructure, sightseeing, and an emphasis 
                on essential destinations and experiences can be found in ancient Greece and Rome, which can lay claim 
                to the origins of both “heritage tourism” (aimed at the celebration and appreciation of historic sites <br><br>
                of recognized cultural importance) and beach resorts. The Seven Wonders of the World became tourist sites for Greeks 
                and Romans.
